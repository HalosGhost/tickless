Tickless
========

This repository will play host to a watchface I am developing for my Pebble Time Steel.
At the moment, it just displays the time and nothing more; however, it will eventually also display the date and a battery bar.
It also has the framework done to allow some basic color configuration.

Note: this watchface is meant to be incredibly minimal (I don't really want a lot of features); but, if there's something you feel it desperately needs, just let me know.
